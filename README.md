I present you a website project whose subject is my person. The site describes my interests and you can  there the software on which I work. The site has one frontend, but I plan to write the same backend for this page in many languages. At the moment I'm thinking about PHP, Python and NodeJS.

Project goal:
- creating a website design,
- using HTML5 and improving CSS skills,
- improving programming skills in PHP,
- student Django framework,
- increasing the general knowledge of web programming.

I plan to add  a functionality that will allow me to easily edit content on the site and  a option to connect to my cloud.

The code of my site is open and you can inspire yourself in building your own site. If you have any advice on how to correct my mistakes, write 
to me!
