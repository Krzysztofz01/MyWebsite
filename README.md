# MyWebsite

MyWebsite - At first glance it is a simple portofilo site. However, behind the minimalist frontend lies
a powerful backend with a microservice architecture. The site not only helps me promote my projects, but
the software itself works as independent modules. Each program consists of an independent database,
REST API and a frontend server in the form of microservices. Thanks to this architecture, the website can
be easily developed, scaled and a correction of the "A" program code will not affect the "B" program.

The technology i used are:
 - NodeJS (ExpressJS, EJS and many more...),
 - Bootstrap (Frontend framework),
 - Docker,
 - Apache (Reverse proxy).
