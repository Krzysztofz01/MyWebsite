# MyWebsite

An old, no longer used version of my portfolio. The portfolio was made using the **Angular** framework. It also had a backend that dealt with **Github** data aggregation, the data was then displayed on the portfolio main page. The site was meant to be a landing page of a larger platform based on the microservice architecture, on which all my projects would be deployed. The concept of this platform has been abandoned and the portfolio has been completely redesigned and is currently available under [this link](http://krzysztofzon.pl/). All the services have been removed from the *master branch* except of the Angular application, however, it is out of date, it is using obsolete versions of the framework and dependencies. The entire project can be considered **deprecated**.

Technologies used today and in the past for the portofolio and platform accros the time:
